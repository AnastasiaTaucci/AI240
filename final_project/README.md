# Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

## Author
Anastasia Taucci

## Project Description
This machine learning project predicts the quality score of red wine (from 3 to 9) based on its chemical features. The goal is to assist winemakers by providing automated, data-driven quality scoring.

## Dataset Information  
The dataset used is a **balanced version** of the UCI Red Wine Quality dataset.  
It contains 21,000 entries with equal representation across wine quality scores.  
Each entry includes 11 chemical features such as alcohol, pH, sulphates, and acidity.
