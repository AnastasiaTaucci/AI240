This folder contains the files for Homework 5, where we built an ANN model to predict customer churn based on Telco customer data. The model uses input features like tenure, monthly charges, contract type, payment method, and other customer details to predict whether a customer is likely to leave.
We used TensorFlow and Keras to design, train, and evaluate the neural network.
